Maths book are fantastic unlike other subjects you don't have to read that boring theory there are some definations if you want to read them read if not then don't <em>(for the god sake, read them definations are important)</em> just see the exercises and solve, well if you struck then why not see some solved examples <em>what the hell are these example</em> ok, ok, I get it maths is hard...  because you suck at them! jokes aside, in primary school my math was also <em>pathetic</em>god and only I remember in my 5th class how much I punish for this maths every saturday when our Sir checks our notes I always got punishment because my work never completed.</div>
