It's am <strong>anthology</strong> means there are more than one story and each one show the different perspective of life in one you are a <strong>monk</strong> and in another one you are a <strong>stockbroker</strong> for one money is a piece of paper and for another one money is everything. There is also a deep lesson about <strong>Mrityu</strong>(death) which was quite interesting for me.</div>
